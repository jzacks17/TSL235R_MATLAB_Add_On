# TSL235R_MATLAB_Add_On
MATLAB add-on package to read the TSL235R sensor through Arduino

The add-on package reads the TSL235R sensor, outputting the irradiance reading 
in ÂµW/cm2. 

Prior to using this add-on package ensure that you have installed the Matlab 
support package for Arduino hardware. 

Create a directory labelled "+arduinoioaddons" on your computer. Download this 
package as a .zip file. Move the "+LightSensor" directory from the .zip file 
into the "+arduinoioaddons" directory. 

To include the add-on package in MATLAB use the addpath() MATLAB function. You 
can check to see if the add-on package has been added by typing 
"listArduinoLibraries" in the MATLAB command window. Look for the library 
titled 'LightSensor/TSL235R'. If it is listed, you have succesfully included 
this add-on package in MATLAB.

To use the library an Arduino object must first be created. When creating the 
Arduino object ensure that you include this add-on package'LightSensor/TSL235R'. 
An example is: 

a = arduino('COM#', 'Uno', 'Libraries', 'LightSensor/TSL235R');

Then to read the TSL235R sensor, a sensor object needs to be created using the 
addon() function. Make sure to include the digital pin that you are reading the 
TSL235R sensor from.
An example is: 

sensor = addon(a,'LightSensor/TSL235R', 'D#');

To read the TSL235R sensor, we can then use the function read(), which will 
output the irradiance reading. Such as: 

irradiance = read(sensor);
